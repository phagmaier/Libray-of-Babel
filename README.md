# LIBRARY OF BABEL

## DESCRIPTION
Generating a lbrary of all possible books (in ASCII).
I was reading about [Kolmogorov complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity)
and I discovered something unintuitive about entropy and comlexity that I found interesting.
I discovered that things that are vague or less specific have a lower Kolmogorov complexity
than there specific counterparts. This code seeks to provide a silly example of this by
generating a infinite library of all (almost) all possibl books that could be generated using 
the english language and limiting yourself to printable ACII characters. So generating a entire
library is actually a smaller and simplier algorithm than generating something like a particular book given
that the book isn't absurdley small.


## File Table

| File | Descripton |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| [main.py](main.py) | Creates the infinite library |


## How to run
DO NOT RUN! 
It won't destroy your computer but it's an infinite library and computer tend not to handle infinities very well.
But if you want to

'''
python main.py
