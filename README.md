# LIBRARY OF BABEL

## DESCRIPTION
Generating a library of all possible books (in ASCII).
I was reading about [Kolmogorov complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity)
and I discovered something unintuitive about entropy and comlexity that I found interesting.
I discovered that things that are vague or less specific have a lower Kolmogorov complexity
than there specific counterparts. This code seeks to provide a silly example of this by
generating a infinite library of all (almost) all possibl books that could be generated using 
the english language and printable ACII characters. As you can see from the code generating a entire
(infinite) library is actually easier, smaller, and simplier than generating something like a particular book given
that the book isn't absurdley small. Idea inspired by th [Borges short story](https://blogs.commons.georgetown.edu/modernities-working-group/files/2013/07/borges_the-library-of-babel.pdf) of the same name.


## File Table

| File | Descripton |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| [main.py](main.py) | Creates the infinite library |


## How to run
DO NOT RUN! 
It won't destroy your computer but it's an infinite library and computers tend not to handle infinities very well.
But if you want to:

```python main.py```
